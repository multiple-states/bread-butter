  <h2>How to make easy white bread</h2>

  <p><strong><a href="#">Bread</a> is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water, usually by baking.</strong> Throughout recorded history it has been popular around the world and is one of the oldest artificial foods, having been of importance since the dawn of <em>agriculture.</em></p>

  <p>There are many <a href="#">combinations</a> and <a href="#">proportions</a> of types of flour and other ingredients, and also of different traditional recipes and modes of preparation of bread. As a result, there are wide varieties of types, shapes, sizes, and textures of breads in various regions. Bread may be leavened by many different processes ranging from the use of naturally occurring microbes (for example in sourdough recipes) to high-pressure artificial aeration methods during preparation or baking. However, some products are left unleavened, either for preference, or for traditional or religious reasons. Many non-cereal ingredients may be included, ranging from fruits and nuts to various fats. Commercial bread in particular, commonly contains additives, some of them non-nutritional, to improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life, or ease of manufacturing.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>500g/1lb 1oz strong white bread flour, plus a little extra flour for finishing</li>
    <li>40g/1½oz soft butter</li>
    <li>12g/2 sachets fast-action dried yeast</li>
    <li>2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>about 300ml/10¾fl oz tepid water (warm not cold – about body temperature)</li>
    <li>a little olive or sunflower oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Preparation method</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Put the flour into a large mixing bowl and add the butter. Add the yeast at one side of the bowl and add the salt at the other, otherwise the salt will kill the yeast. Stir all the ingredients with a spoon to combine.</li>
    <li>Add half of the water and turn the mixture round with your fingers. Continue to add water a little at a time, combining well, until you’ve picked up all of the flour from the sides of the bowl. You may not need to add all of the water, or you may need to add a little more – you want a dough that is well combined and soft, but not sticky or soggy. Mix with your fingers to make sure all of the ingredients are combined and use the mixture to clean the inside of the bowl. Keep going until the mixture forms a rough dough.</li>
    <li>Use about a teaspoon of oil to lightly grease a clean work surface (using oil instead of flour will keep the texture of the dough consistent). Turn out your dough onto the greased work surface (make sure you have plenty of space).</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Techniques</h3>

  <p>Now use your hands to knead the dough: push the dough out in one direction with the heel of your hand, then fold it back on itself. Turn the dough by 90 degrees and repeat. Kneading in this way stretches the gluten and makes the dough elastic. Do this for about 4 or 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and stretchy. Work quickly so that the mixture doesn’t stick to your hands – if it does get too sticky you can add a little flour to your hands.</p>

  <p>Once the dough has doubled in size scrape it out of the bowl to shape it. The texture should be bouncy and shiny. Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knock it back by kneading it firmly to 'knock' out the air. Use your hand to roll the dough up, then turn by 45 degrees and roll it up again. Repeat several times. Gently turn and smooth the dough into a round loaf shape.</p>
