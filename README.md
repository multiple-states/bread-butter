php-starter-template
====================
Version 3.0

A php starter template maintained by Will McLean - willmcl@gmail.com

General description:
This starter template is a good place to start for building the type of sites I generally build. It simplifies the setup of a site by including the bare minimum I begin with. Namely it has a custom inclusion of bootstrap for a grid framework and a simple grunt build setup. It also includes snippets for reuseable elements I use in many sites, ie. menus.
