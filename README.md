Bread and butter
====================
Version 0.10.0 (Beta)

When you make a sandwich you don't bake the bread, you just add the flavour! A starter template for website builds. Bread and Butter is maintained by Multiple States. 

General description
--------------

This starter template is a good place to start for building the type of sites we generally build. It simplifies the setup of a site by including the bare minimum we begin with. 

* It uses the task automator Grunt (http://gruntjs.com/) for an easy build setup
* It uses the package manager Bower (http://bower.io/) to install dependencies like jquery and modernizer 
* It uses the Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) framework for a mobile first responsive grid system
* It is designed to be used with a module based workflow (https://github.com/multiple-states/bread-butter/wiki/workflow) for all your website elements
* It uses the css pre-processor Less (http://lesscss.org/) for more powerful styling

Make sure you read through this wiki ( https://github.com/willmcl/bread-butter/wiki ) before diving into the project. If you have no experience with the technologies listed above don't be afraid, it is all dead easy after you read the wiki and do a little research on those technologies. We promise.

As this template is built with php you need to use MAMP (http://www.mamp.info/en/) to run it on your local machine. You also need to have some experience with Git (http://git-scm.com/). If you don't have any experience with _Git_ then take the time to learn it... Change your life that will.
